# Introduction #

See http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/w/list for more information and the sister project [OhBoy](http://code.google.com/p/ohboy/)

gnuboy is a portable Gameboy emulator originally created by Laguna and Gilgamesh. The last public release by Laguna was 1.0.3 _but_ some code was available for 1.0.4 in a CVS server (that is now offline). The gnuboy website is offline but Laguna does still have tarballs of the source available. See http://wikibin.org/articles/gnuboy.html for some history.

This project has an SVN repo (with _some_ but not all history) for version 0.8.0 up to 1.0.3. It also includes the 1.0.4 changes. Subversion is used as it is the Esperanto of source code control, most users know how to use it. If you prefer a distributed system like Mercurial or git you can do so using the gateway options (for example the SVN repo was populated from Mercurial using hgsubversion).

Documentation is available in http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/#svn/trunk/docs the document most users will be interested in is the [configuration doc](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/trunk/docs/CONFIG), that talks about key remapping (amongst other things).

There are various [Ports](Ports.md) of gnuboy, some with enhancements. [r21](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/detail?r=21) and earlier are the original sources.

I'm looking for contact information for Laguna (laguna@aerifal.cx bounces).
