See http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/w/list  and [Features](Features.md) for more information and the sister project [OhBoy](http://code.google.com/p/ohboy/) (OhBoy is gnuboy for SDL with a simple menu system).

gnuboy is a portable Gameboy emulator originally created by Laguna and Gilgamesh, now maintained by clach04. See [GNUBoyHistory](GNUBoyHistory.md)  for more details.

For building see [BuildNotes](BuildNotes.md).

Documentation is available in http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/#svn/trunk/docs the document most users will be interested in is the [configuration doc](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/trunk/docs/CONFIG), that talks about key remapping (amongst other things).

There are various [Ports](Ports.md) of gnuboy, some with enhancements. [r21](http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/detail?r=21) and earlier are the original sources.

This project is currently focused on:
  * SDL port (linux 86 and win32)
  * DingooPort which is another SDL port for the Dingoo A320 (Native and OpenDingux)
  * SDL port number 2 with menu [OhBoy](http://code.google.com/p/ohboy/) which adds a simple menu system (for SDL only).

gnuboy is also known to build/run on the Pandora (ARM) and Caanoo (ARM).
